# UPI-Transaction-Analysis

## Overview
This project analyzes UPI transaction data to understand transaction behavior, reliability, and key success drivers using Python, SQL, and Power BI.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn)
- SQL (SQLite)
- Power BI

## Workflow
1. Performed data cleaning and feature engineering in Python.
2. Conducted exploratory data analysis to study transaction patterns.
3. Built a Random Forest model to predict transaction success and analyzed feature importance.
4. Used SQL queries to compute KPIs and failure rates.
5. Designed a single-page Power BI dashboard for visualization and insights.

## Key Insights
- Transaction amount and time of day significantly influence success rates.
- Transaction failures vary across applications.
- Most transactions occur during peak evening hours.
